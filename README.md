# Circlepe_frontend_Assesment

This assessment is being done as a part of my placement drive where we have to attempt to create a Responsive Website Implementation
Two links were provided
1. Figma Design Link
2. Figma Prototype Link
The prototype demonstrates the user interactions and transitions between different pages or components. 

As an attempt, I have created the 2D static design of the most basic level of the home page where we filter our search as per our requirement 

Tools used: Figma, Github ( for deployment )
